# Features
* Double-click to close tabs.
* Preserve the last tab (prevents the browser from closing when the last tab is closed; clicking the 'X' won't work).
* Mouse hover to scroll the tab bar.
* Right-click and scroll the tab bar.
* Portable design: the program is placed in the App directory, and data is stored in the Data directory (incompatible with the original data; you can reinstall the system or change computers without losing data).
* Allow configuration of features using ini files.
* Allow custom Chromium startup parameters.
* Remove update error warnings (since it's a green version without automatic update functionality).

# Download

# Installation
